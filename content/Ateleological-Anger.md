I often visited the bar to make new friends. Being smashed out of your mind led to interesting conversations apparently. This one dude sitting beside me with his head ducked down drinking loads was however, very different. 

For one, he seemed to be drinking because he wanted to be sad, not because he was sad. I could see it in his exaggerated despair. His lips parted, waiting for more liquor. His eyes fixed on the glass in front of him. I could see his objective was to just drink, rather than forget his sorrows. Whatever happened to him, it did not affect him as much as he wants it to.

I adjusted closer to him, hoping for an interesting conversation, and kept a hand on his shoulder lightly patting, hoping he comes out of his trance. He turned to see me after a moment, wiping his face looking at me with an expression that inquired my intent. I withdrew from him and said, "you seem...sad...something happened?". I could've worded it way better in hindsight, but it was still polite enough, or so I think. 

He waved his hand with an annoyed expression. Signalling that I am not worthy of a response, which was offensive to me in some respect. His callousness only made me want to know him further.

I tried introducing myself, "My name is Johann Meze, I am a regular here. You don't seem familiar". At this point I was slowly becoming aware of how my words felt confrontational rather than friendly. "This is my first time...drinking." He replied leaning on the counter as a support, looking at the shelves, where the drinks were stored.

"Oh, well how's it going?" I asked hoping to cheer him up. "Terrible, this is abysmal" he replied looking down at his glass. "You guys drink this? Regular?". I couldn't help but giggle at his childlike innocence. "You'll get acquainted to it. What prompted you to start drinking though?" I asked, hoping to get an insight in this character. I could see him looking away nervous. His lips twitching as if trying to answer for themselves. He was doing a good job of holding himself back. 

I however, was determined to get through his tough exterior. "Was it...a she?", I asked lowering my tone. I could see his fingers twitching, as he formed a fist. He was really trying to be angry at that insinuation, which only proved that I was correct. "Listen it happens, " I continued patting his shoulder again just then, i received a firm smack on my face. I fell down on the floor, my chair following me.

I was more intrigued than hurt by that hit. I looked up at him surprised, trying to make sense of it. He was curled up, his head resting on his palms on the table. I helped myself up, thinking he must be feeling guilty. I continued again "It's fine, i understand you're hurt" which was quickly interrupted by his quick "sorry". Looking to do away with his action as efficiently as possible. "It's been hard for me," he continued his head still hiding away in his hands. "I thought she loved me, I really did", he was getting emotional every second. His voice swell with unshed tears. I really wanted to stop this before it got too far and boring, but I could not.

I tried to offer him some solace to end the awkwardness. This worked, but now he took me for some kind soul that was trying to help him. This happened a lot with me for some reason. He was sorry for the fact that he slapped me, extremely so. 

"Listen, you didn't slap me because you were angry but you wanted to be angry that's why you slapped me." He was listening intently to me now. "We need to do whatever we can to try to be happy not angr-", I looked down on my expensive suit which was now flowing with some of the rum that the bartender spilled. I looked up at him, stood up and hit him with a vicious right hand over his chin. 

As he fell down with a thud, I took a moment to notice my friend's reaction. He was beyond amused but also somehow impressed. I don't know how to describe it. I smiled back at him, at this moment we shared more mutual understanding than ever before.
